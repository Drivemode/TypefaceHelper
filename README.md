# TypefaceHelper

Helper object for injecting typeface into various text views of android.

## Overview

We can use various custom typefaces asset for any text views(like TextView, Button, RadioButton, EditText, etc.),
but there's no way to set the typeface as a styled theme to apply the typeface for overall screens in the app.

This library helps to do it in easy way :)

And there's also a serious bug that creating typeface from asset resource will cause memory leak ([See this link](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9904) for more details),
this library will take care about this problem as well.

## How to use

First, put your typeface into `asset` directory.

In your application class, take care about the helper object lifecycle.

```java
public class MyApp extends Application {
  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    TypefaceHelper.initialize(this);
  }

  @Override
  public void onTerminate() {
    TypefaceHelper.destroy();
    super.onTerminate();
  }
}
```

And in your activity, if you would like to set your typeface to a text view,

```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    TextView hello = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.hello_world);
    TypefaceHelper.getInstance().setTypeface(hello, "font/font_file.ttf");
  }
}
```

You can also set your typeface for all text views that belong to a specific view group just like this.

```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    LinearLayout container = (LinearLayout) findViewById(R.id.text_container);
    TypefaceHelper.getInstance().setTypeface(container, "font/font_file.ttf");
  }
}
```

If you want to apply the typeface for all text views under the activity layout,

```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(TypefaceHelper.getInstance().setTypeface(this, R.layout.activity_main, "font/font_file.ttf"));
  }
}
```

Nice and easy!

You can apply the typeface to your whole window like this.

```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.layout_activity_main);
    TypefaceHelper.getInstance().setTypeface(this, "font/font_file.ttf");
  }
}
```
